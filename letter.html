     <h1 class="letter-title">Dear Aarni,</h1>

    <pre class="letter-text">
I never knew a person could feel like home until you came into my life. With you, I don’t feel the need to explain myself or pretend to be anything else. I can just be me — and somehow, that feels like enough.

It’s a feeling I carry quietly. I find it in your voice, in the way you listen, and even in the comfortable silences we share. Nothing feels forced. Nothing feels awkward. Things just feel… lighter when you’re around.

On days when the world feels a little too loud or my thoughts don’t slow down, I think of you. You have this calm about you that makes everything feel less overwhelming. Even ordinary moments seem softer when they include you.

Somewhere along the way, without me even realizing when it happened, my appreciation for you turned into something deeper. I didn’t plan it, and I didn’t rush it — it just grew naturally. And the truth is… I love you. Not in a loud, dramatic way, but in a quiet, certain way. In the way I care about your happiness, the way your presence matters to my day, and the way my world feels better with you in it.

Maybe home was never about a place. Maybe it was always about finding someone who makes you feel at ease without even trying. And somewhere along the way, being around you started to feel like that for me.

I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate the comfort, warmth, and peace you bring into my life — more than I probably say out loud. And with you, I finally feel like I've arrived.
